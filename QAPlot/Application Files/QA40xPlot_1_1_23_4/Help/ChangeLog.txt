--------------------------------------------
This changelog shows the changes made for each version
--------------------------------------------
v 1.1.23
- improve dark and light dialog renditions on switch
- repair right channel individual harmonics/imds displayed values
- add early sinad math
v 1.1.22
- huge upgrade to the color picker to change dynamically
- seriously improve color selection
- add two configurations (LightView and DarkView) as examples
- add pin graph range option to graph settings
- fix mic compensation low-end bug
v 1.1.21
- add a couple of fields to Settings display
- improve localization of values shown in data summary box and entries
- support flip of percent/v in data summary box also when stopped and in ghosts
- slight change to thd calculation for spectrum
- change intermodulation distortion summary values to the right values
v 1.1.20
- add microphone compensation to response test and settings
	this uses linear frequency interpolation of the loaded compensation file
- add data summary box to the scope test
	very preliminary, but working
- line up gui fields more uniformly
- fix (more) .using amplifier load. for Impedance test
- let user set windowing in frequency response test

v 1.1.19
- start using the 4 term version # from the installer
- Repair the constant overlaying for both THDvsAmp and THDvsFreq
- add a bunch of tooltips including to the data summary box
- improve binning of sweep frequencies
v 1.1.18
- fix left/right swap of noise floor
- repair up-down control positioning on-screen
- save current window size and position in configuration
- enhance color picker transparency display
- enhance plot color choices
- add multitone (30 logarithmic spaced sines) waveform 
   warning->much higher total power than a sine wave
- improve auto attenuation math
- fix enbw missing in noise floor and thd+n math
v 1.1.17
- add unit conversion to voltage inputs (not serialized yet)
v 1.1.16
- fix the impedance cursor phase math
- swap to not using deploy suffix but set all git to binary
v 1.1.15
- enable saving loaded tests
- add plot colors to the Get settings
- enable color selection via a color picker dialog
- refactor out otherset class
- add this file (Changelog.txt) to the distribution and link to it
- create a ClickOnce installation and use github.io for it
v 1.1.14
- repair right channel math error
- swap up/down buttons on updown control
- repair Spectrum signal expander binding
v 1.1.13
- add inductor/capacitor cursor for impedance test
- add ability to select a theme
- swapped out updown for a usercontrol
- alphabetize settings
- add expanders to the UI portion of the screen
- move miniplots to a separate window
- swap input channels if QA402
v 1.1.12
- increase max # of averages to 20
- add 88,16K fft sizes
- swap amp load resistance to correct ZReference on impedance test
- do averaging in the frequency domain
- improve translucency in plot lines
- add graph background color selection
v 1.1.11
- fix load of a saved tab half-erasing the get list
- swap to more standard colors for the get list
v 1.1.10
- repair IMD signal to noise math when a frequency is near 20KHz
- repair tab save never highlights in THD vs amp and THD vs frequency
- repair unit name in THD vs amp Y axis
- start capturing on perceived data start rather than immediately
- remove double-scan for gain tests and instead correctly
  allow time for circuit to settle after relays switch
  based on empirical test of relay vs signal
v 1.1.9
- refine the esthetics, like boundary of graph
- support settable background color
- refactor most of the gui xaml by using subcontrols
v 1.1.8
- totally refactor the usb/rest code to use an interface & factory
-- yank out REST use of 'internal' oscillators and queries
- remove redundant color code to slim binding way down
- fix the autorange display to show both values
v 1.1.7
- support multiple 'get' files
-- upgrade all tests to enable multiples
-- allow removing entries
-- display r/l for each entry
-- add a list gui
v 1.1.6
- lots of cleanup to the usb/rest connections to reduce overhead
v 1.1.5
- repair popup windows initial visual state
- swap to manual powerline setting
v 1.1.4
- multiple load/save improvements
-- inclusion in window fit calculation
-- improved color choices/esthetics
-- support for data summaries
v1.1.3
- finish tab load/save implementation as "Other"
- add tab info display to each tab window
- add a REST support layer to allow either interface
v 1.1.1, 1.1.2
- start tab load/save implementation
- improve settling issues when noise measurement
- set the device to Attenuation when a test finishes so the device stays attenuated
- improvements to the thd/snr/noise algorithms
v 1.1.0
- First version with direct to USB support

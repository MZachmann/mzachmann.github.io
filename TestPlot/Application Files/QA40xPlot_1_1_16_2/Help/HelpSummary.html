<h1 style="color:red">Common Options</h1>
<h1>Keyboard Accelerators</h1>
<p>
    The left hand user interface entries on every tab are accessible by Alt-key combinations. Press and release the Alt key to
    see underlines appear on the prompts. Each underlined letter is a keyboard accelerator. So Alt-V, for example, usually lets you
    edit the voltage entry. Alt-R turns auto-ranging on and off, etc.
</p>

<h1>Graph Manipulation</h1>
<p>Common to all tests are plots of values. You can change them easily by</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click a plot and drag the mouse to move the plot center point around.</li>
    <li>Right-click a plot and drag the mouse to zoom in or out in the mouse direction.</li>
    <li>Scroll the mouse wheel in a plot to zoom in or out</li>
    <li>Click a plot axis and drag the mouse to reposition that axis.</li>
    <li>Right-click a plot axis and drag the mouse to zoom in or out that axis.</li>
    <li>Scroll the mouse wheel over a plot axis to zoom that axis in or out</li>
    <li>--</li>
    <li>Click inside the plot to freeze a cursor. Click again to unfreeze.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Amplitude Definitions</h1>
<p>All tests have a choice as to how the QA40x generator voltage is determined.</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Setting</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Input Voltage</strong></td>
            <td>The desired DUT input voltage. This is the QA40x generator output voltage.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Output Voltage</strong></td>
            <td>Determine generator voltage to produce the desired DUT output. This does a low-voltage gain calculation first</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Output Power</strong></td>
            <td>Use the amplifier load setting (see Settings) to determine output voltage from power and then use gain to calculate the input/generator voltage</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h1>Attenuation Settings</h1>
<p>QA40x attenuation is important for test device integrity. QA40xPlot tries very hard to use just enough attenuation for each test. Attenuation is always calculated based on both input channels (left and right) of the QA40x. If you only plan to test one channel we recommend you short the other QA40x input channel, which will guarantee that attenuation math ignores the shorted channel.</p>
<p>The free-running tests: Spectrum, Intermodulation and Scope, have manual or automatic attenuation. The other tests all automatically check gain then automatically determine attenuation to avoid QA40x overload in either channel.</p>
<p>The THD vs Frequency sweep calculates/uses one generator voltage that it then sweeps with. If you select an output amplitude that voltage ensures the maximum output of the sweep is that setting. The Input Voltage setting uses that voltage for the sweep.</p>
<p>The THD vs Amplitude test calculates distortion at each swept amplitude and varies generator voltage accordingly. Attenuation may increase as output voltage increases.</p>
<p>All 3 response tests (Response, Gain, Impedance) use a single generator voltage just like the THD vs Frequency test.</p>
<h1>Cursor</h1>
<p>All of the tests support a <strong>cursor</strong>. As you move your mouse in the plot a small box in the lower right shows the nearest data point. Some charts have a visual on-screen point, some don&#39;t.</p>
<h1>Tab Get, Load, and Save</h1>
<p>
    Each tab has a Get, a Load and a Save button in the left hand column at the bottom. When saved, the tab settings and plot data
    are saved to a compressed .plt file (by default named something.plt.zip). This file can be manually opened in Windows and the contents are a JSON text file. It can also, of course,
    be loaded.
</p>
<p>
    When a saved tab is loaded two things happen. First, the plot data is displayed. Second, the original sweep settings are
    entered back into the user interface. So, the screen will look exactly as it did when the sweep/test was run. This lets you know
    exactly what settings you used for the test. It also allows for limited examination of the plot data.
</p>
<p>
    When a saved tab is gotten (Get) the name will show up under the button with an L and R checkbox.
    Click the L and R to have the two channels show up on top of the current data.
    Click the color boxes below the L and R to change the plot line colors.
    Add more saved tabs by clicking the Get button again.
    Click the garbage icon to remove a saved tab. This will not delete the file on-disk.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Settings</h1>
<h1>The global Settings tab</h1>
<p>
    There is one tab named "Settings" that shows the various global settings. These include colors, color themes,
    amplifier load, external gain block, and others.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Test Descriptions</h1>
<h1 style="color:green">Spectrum Test</h1>
<p>This test sends a single sine wave out from the generator and plots the received frequency spectral data (value vs frequency). For a Sine wave this produces a skinny spike at the sine frequency surrounded by background noise and (usually harmonic) distortion spikes.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use Chirp - turn this on to use a chirp signal for the sweep. This is a more efficient way to sweep a frequency range. It suffers from
        reduced distortion and gain accuracy but gains almost continuous frequency coverage in a single packet. When using chirp, the right channel is used as reference if active.

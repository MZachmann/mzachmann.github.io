- add plot colors to the Get settings
- enable color selection via a color picker dialog
- refactor out otherset class
- add this file (Changelog.txt) to the distribution and link to it
- create a ClickOnce installation and use github.io for it
v 1.1.14
- repair right channel math error
- swap up/down buttons on updown control
- repair Spectrum signal expander binding
v 1.1.13
- add inductor/capacitor cursor for impedance test
- add ability to select a theme
- swapped out updown for a usercontrol
- alphabetize settings
- add expanders to the UI portion of the screen
- move miniplots to a separate window
- swap input channels if QA402
v 1.1.12
- increase max # of averages to 20
- add 88,16K fft sizes
- swap amp load resistance to correct ZReference on impedance test
- do averaging in the frequency domain
- improve translucency in plot lines
- add graph background color selection
v 1.1.11
- fix load of a saved tab half-erasing the get list
- swap to more standard colors for the get list
v 1.1.10
- repair IMD signal to noise math when a frequency is near 20KHz
- repair tab save never highlights in THD vs amp and THD vs frequency
- repair unit name in THD vs amp Y axis
- start capturing on perceived data start rather than immediately
- remove double-scan for gain tests and instead correctly
  allow time for circuit to settle after relays switch
  based on empirical test of relay vs signal
v 1.1.9
- refine the esthetics, like boundary of graph
- support settable background color
- refactor most of the gui xaml by using subcontrols
v 1.1.8
- totally refactor the usb/rest code to use an interface & factory
-- yank out REST use of 'internal' oscillators and queries
- remove redundant color code to slim binding way down
- fix the autorange display to show both values
v 1.1.7
- support multiple 'get' files
-- upgrade all tests to enable multiples
-- allow removing entries
-- display r/l for each entry
-- add a list gui
v 1.1.6
- lots of cleanup to the usb/rest connections to reduce overhead
v 1.1.5
- repair popup windows initial visual state
- swap to manual powerline setting
v 1.1.4
- multiple load/save improvements
-- inclusion in window fit calculation
-- improved color choices/esthetics
-- support for data summaries
v1.1.3
- finish tab load/save implementation as "Other"
- add tab info display to each tab window
- add a REST support layer to allow either interface
v 1.1.1, 1.1.2
- start tab load/save implementation
- improve settling issues when noise measurement
- set the device to Attenuation when a test finishes so the device stays attenuated
- improvements to the thd/snr/noise algorithms
v 1.1.0
- First version with direct to USB support
